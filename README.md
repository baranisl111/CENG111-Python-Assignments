# CENG111 - Python Assignments

This repository includes three Python assignments completed for the CENG111: Introduction to Programming course at Middle East Technical University (METU). The projects cover core programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, recursion, lists, dictionaries, and custom logic design.

## Assignment 1 ‚Äì Babysitter Cost & Rule Validator (`the2.py`)
Implements a rule-based calendar validation system for assigning babysitters and family members to calendar slots. The program checks various constraints (rules) for the presence and arrangement of people like "mother", "father", "aunt", etc., and calculates the total babysitting cost if all rules are satisfied. Otherwise, it returns a list of violated rule numbers.

**Topics Covered:** List operations, indexing, custom constraint checking, cost calculation logic, nested conditions.

## Assignment 2 ‚Äì Intersection Area of Triangle and Rectangle (`the3.py`)
Calculates the area of overlap between a triangle and a rectangle given as lists of coordinate points. The implementation includes geometry logic for:
- Finding line equations and intersections,
- Checking point inclusion in polygons,
- Sorting intersection points to compute polygon area using the shoelace formula.

**Topics Covered:** Geometry, coordinate systems, custom math functions, algorithmic problem solving, trigonometry.

## Assignment 3 ‚Äì Family Tree Analyzer (`the4.py`)
Simulates a family tree structure as nested lists and implements relationship-detection functions such as `siblings`, `cousins`, `uncles`, `aunts`, `brothers`, and `sisters`. The code parses the structure into generations and uses index-based logic to detect relationships.

**Topics Covered:** Recursive data traversal, string parsing, dictionary usage, family hierarchy simulation.
